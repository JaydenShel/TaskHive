CI/CD Setup Guide

This project includes CI/CD workflows using GitHub Actions. The goal is to keep code quality high and make deployments smooth and repeatable.

Workflows
1. CI Pipeline (.github/workflows/ci.yml)

Triggers: Pushes to main or develop, Pull Requests
Steps included:

Frontend: lint, build, test

Backend: dependency check, security audit

Security: npm audit, dependency checks

Database: schema validation

Artifacts: upload build outputs

2. Deploy to Production (.github/workflows/deploy.yml)

Triggers: Pushes to main, or manual dispatch
Steps included:

Build frontend

Deploy to S3 bucket

Invalidate CloudFront cache

Create deployment tags

3. Pull Request Checks (.github/workflows/pr-check.yml)

Triggers: Pull Requests to main or develop
Steps included:

Code quality analysis

Bundle size checks

Detection of console.log statements

Automatic PR comment with results

Setup Instructions
1. Enable GitHub Actions

Go to the repository → Actions tab

Enable Actions if not already enabled

2. Add Repository Secrets

In Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions, add:

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
AWS_REGION=us-east-2
S3_BUCKET=your_bucket_name

# Optional
CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID=your_distribution_id
BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend.com
DEPLOY_BACKEND=true

3. Branch Protection (Recommended)

Go to Settings → Branches

Add a rule for the main branch:

Require status checks to pass

Require branches to be up to date

Select the CI workflow as required

Workflow Lifecycle

On push to main:

CI pipeline runs all checks

If CI passes → deploy runs

If CI fails → deploy is blocked

On pull request:

CI pipeline runs checks

PR analysis provides feedback

Merge blocked until checks pass

Manual deployment:

Go to Actions → Deploy to Production

Run workflow manually

Monitoring and Debugging

Workflow runs can be viewed in the Actions tab

Logs for each run show exactly where a step failed

Common issues:

CI fails: check linting errors or build issues

Deploy fails: verify AWS credentials and S3 permissions

Slow builds: review npm cache and dependency sizes

Next Steps

Push to the repository to trigger the first CI run

Review the Actions tab for any issues

Add AWS credentials as repository secrets

Future improvements:

Add more unit tests

Introduce a staging environment

Add performance monitoring

Configure Slack or Discord notifications

Troubleshooting

Workflow not running:

Confirm .github/workflows/ files exist

Check branch names match workflow triggers

Ensure Actions are enabled

Permission errors:

Verify AWS credentials

Check S3 bucket permissions

Ensure GitHub Actions has repo access

Build failures:

Confirm package.json scripts exist

Verify dependencies are in package-lock.json

Look for syntax errors in code
